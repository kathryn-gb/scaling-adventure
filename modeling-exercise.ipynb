    "## Problem framing\n",
    "I can imagine a couple different ways to approach this. We could focus on being able to predict loans that will be fully paid, and construct a binary outcome accordingly. However, thinking in terms of which loans are best to invest in, we will also want to consider things like the term and interest rate. If we can be confident that some larger set of loans are very likely to stay current (and eventually be paid off), representing roughly equally low risk, we will be able to further optimize our choice based on which will provide the highest return. Therefore, I'm still going to construct a binary, just with both current and fully paid as the 1 - besides my logic above, I don't think it's useful information for our classifier to differentiate between each negative outcome category. There are so few 'bad' outcomes that we might as well avoid them altogether, even if, say, sometimes the grace period loans bounce back. "

    "Normally I would spend a lot longer on this step, and test out a few different approaches in a pipeline. We have a fairly high number of features here. I may test for highly correlated features, or test out an algorithmic attempt at dimensionality reduction. I may evaluate whether some numeric features should be binned. I may more closely evaluate the distributions of my numeric features and apply some statistical transformations. With categorical variables like emp_title with many distinct values, I may seek to collapse the values into fewer categories. Since this is just an exercise, I'm just going to do a simple process for getting a baseline performance, deal with NAs and scaling numerics, encode categoricals and move on. \n"
